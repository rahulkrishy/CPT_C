### C_Concepts:

This section is the foundation of your C programming learning path. Each subtopic delves into a core concept in C programming, accompanied by practical code examples.

- **Basic:**
   - `Hello_World`: Your first C program.
   - `Typedef`: Simplifying type definitions.
   - `SwitchCase`: Implementing conditional logic.
   - `enum`: Working with enumerations.
   - `StorageClass`: Understanding variable scope and lifetime.

- **Array:**
   - `2D_Array`: Manipulating two-dimensional arrays.
   - `Multi_DimentionalArray`: Working with multi-dimensional arrays.

- **String:**
   - `StringReading`: Reading strings from user input.
   - `String-Output_Formatting`: Formatting strings for output.
   - `StringFunction`: Using built-in string functions.
   - `StringWithoutFunction`: Manual string manipulation.

- **Pointers:**
   - `Pointers`: Introduction to pointer variables.
   - `PointerAddressincrement`: Incrementing pointer addresses.
   - `PointerStringAccess`: Accessing strings via pointers.
   - `PointerToFunction`: Using function pointers.
   - `DoublePointer`: Working with double pointers.
   - `Pointer-Access_1DArray`: Accessing 1D arrays using pointers.
   - `Pointers-Access_2DArray`: Accessing 2D arrays with pointers.

- **Recursion:**
   - `Recursion-Find_SumofDigit`: Recursive function to calculate sum of digits.
   - `Recursion-Find_Factorial`: Factorial calculation using recursion.
   - `Recursion-Find_FibonacciSeries`: Generating Fibonacci series recursively.

- **Structure_Union:**
   - `Structure`: Defining and using structures.
   - `Structure-ArrayAccess_StudentDetails`: Accessing arrays of structures.
   - `StuctureWithPointer`: Structure pointers in action.
   - `StuctureWithFunction`: Passing structures to functions.
   - `StructureVsUnion`: Key differences between structures and unions.
   - `Union_Size`: Memory management in unions.

- **FileHandling:**
   - `FileHandling`: Basics of file operations.
   - `FileHandling-Read_Write`: Reading from and writing to files.
   - `FileHandling-Functions`: Essential file handling functions.

- **DynamicMemoryAllocation:**
   - `DynamicMemoryAllocation-malloc`: Allocating memory dynamically with `malloc()`.
   - `DynamicMemoryAllocation-calloc`: Using `calloc()` for dynamic memory allocation.
   - `DynamicMemoryAllocation-realloc`: Reallocating memory with `realloc()`.

- **MemoryManagement:**
   - `MemoryHandling-Functions`: Memory handling techniques and functions.

- **DSA:**
   - `Binary Search Algorithm`: Implementation of binary search in C.

### C_Practice:

This section provides a collection of coding exercises aimed at helping you master key concepts. Practice challenges are included for:

- **Array**
- **Patterns**
- **Pointers**
- **Recursion**
- **ToFind Types**

---

### C_Tasks:

Challenge yourself with practical C projects. These tasks are designed to test your knowledge and build real-world coding skills.

- `Calculator.c`: Develop a basic calculator program.
- `ContactListManagementSystem.c`: Build a contact management system.
- `NumberGuessingGame.c`: Create a fun number guessing game.

---

### C_Template:

To help you set up your development environment, we've included a `.vscode tasks.json` template file for Visual Studio Code. This will streamline your coding and testing process.
